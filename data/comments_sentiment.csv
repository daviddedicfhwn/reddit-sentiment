During contest mode, it's impossible to tell which comments are getting more traction and which ones aren't, so of course there are going to be people there downvoting the judgements they disagree with rather than just irrelevant ones, because people are legitimately invested in the post getting the judgement they think is correct, which is determined by the post with the most upvotes. It's really easy to ignore comments you disagree with and not downvote them, imo, when the post is out of judgement mode and the bad takes have under 20 votes, verses in contest mode when for all you know the bad take could become the top comment.

And oftentimes doordash orders are 50+ dollars. And upper management doesn't care how short staffed you are they want results. Having to make food for just cars in drive through versus those and giant ass door dashes are two different beasts.and the orders just pop out of nowhere.

They can take two games off of the 1 seed and team most likely to go to the finals. That's without their point guard, their max centre not playing very well (and injured for game 6), minimal bench help, some poor coaching decisions (Monty not calling a timeout when the Nuggets ran up their lead yesterday among other decisions), and very little time for Booker and KD to adjust to playing with each other and for KD to learn Phoenix's system in general. Now they have an off-season to likely off-load CP3 and acquire depth they desperately need, hire a new coach (Nick Nurse? Bud?), possibly move Ayton, and a full season to prepare for the playoffs.",t1_jjvfj1x,9

Then last month, she suddenly collapsed, and I rushed her into the hospital, ready to heal her up... but the doctor said it's too late. My heart sank, my baby girl was going to pass away, I begged the doctor to save her, but there was nothing they could do. I lost my best friend, my gaming buddy, my LAN party mascot when my friends would come over to the game, my baby girl... in a blink of an eye, she passed away as while giving me one last nose kiss while I held her. The leftover money was used to build this pc (Ryzen 7800x3d with a 7900xtx build) so that I can remember all the good times I had with her.
