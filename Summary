Good Points
  - Intresting Idea!
  - Very good use of functions!
  - Good paragrafphs above the function for clearness!
  - Overall a very good Challenge --> for me clearly a 6 ;)
  - Descriptions of commits are very good --> easy to understand what has been updated
  
What to do better next time?
  - Maybe some extra comments above some for loops to make it clearer
  - Maybe describe the structure of the different folders and what is inside to have a better overview
